# Use Cases Overview

Simplicity can be used for a wide range of financial applications.

## Blockstream's reference implementations

Examples developed by Blockstream include

* [Simplicity DEX](./simplicity-dex/) for financial options
* [Simplicity Lending Protocol](./lending-protocol/) for collateralized lending ([implementation](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity-lending))
* [SHRINCS Simplicity verifier](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/shrincs-simplicity-verifier), for [Simplicity-based postquantum signature verification](https://blog.blockstream.com/blockstream-research-demonstrates-quantum-resistant-transaction-signing-on-liquid-using-simplicity-smart-contracts/) on Liquid (see also the [PQ Liquid Wallet](https://github.com/smeneguz/pq-liquid-wallet) hackathon project)

## Simplicity projects built by others

* [Resolvr](https://resolvr.io/) has created [Astrolabe](https://docs.simplicity-lang.org/news/2026/02/20/video-resolvr-astrolabe-demo/), a Simplicity-based reinsurance investment platform, and [Deadcat](https://github.com/Resolvr-io/deadcat), a Simplicity-based prediction market.
* [SideSwap](https://sideswap.io/) has [launched](https://sideswap.io/news/sideswap-press-release/) [Swaption](https://swaption.io/), a Simplicity-based noncustodial binary options marketplace.
* [StarkWare](https://starkware.co/) has used Simplicity to [implement a STARK verifier](https://starkware.co/blog/building-starks-in-simplicity/).
* [OceanSlim](https://github.com/0ceanslim) has created [anchor](https://github.com/0ceanSlim/anchor), a constant-product automated-market maker (AMM).

## Other examples and ideas

Check out the [SimplicityHL examples](https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SimplicityHL/tree/master/examples) for other introductory smart contract examples, including [vault](../glossary.md#vault) and [covenant](../glossary.md#covenant) mechanisms.

In addition to options, lending, insurance, and prediction markets, Simplicity is expected to support

* Cross-chain atomic swaps
* Crowdfunding contracts
<!-- * Discreet log contracts -->
* Bitcoin native smart contracts via Simplicity Unchained
* Vaults (multi-stage withdrawals)
