=== "Rust"

    # Rust quickstart

    This is the **Rust version** of the quickstart. You'll perform a [Liquid](../glossary.md#liquid) testnet transaction using the "last will" [covenant](../glossary.md#covenant). This allows an inheritor to claim funds after a delay if their benefactor goes silent, while the benefactor can postpone that indefinitely just by checking in.

    ## The contract
    
    `last_will.simf` demonstrates an inheritance-after-timeout pattern, using three keys and three spending paths:
    
    * **Inheritor key** — after a [timelock](../glossary.md#timelock) has elapsed, the inheritor can claim everything.
    * **Hot key** — the benefactor can "check in" at any time. Checking in re-creates the exact same contract at a new [UTXO](../glossary.md#utxo) (a [recursive covenant](../glossary.md#recursive-covenant)) and resets the inheritor's timelock. This is the key the benefactor is expected to use day-to-day.
    * **Cold key** — the benefactor can also break out of the covenant entirely and move the funds anywhere, no matter what the timelock says. This key would typically be kept offline, since it's only needed in unusual circumstances. This quickstart doesn't exercise this path.

        C -. "Cold key:<br>any time" .-> O[Owner's own wallet]
    ```
    
    Its code (from the <a href="https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SimplicityHL/blob/master/examples/last_will.simf">SimplicityHL examples</a>) looks like this:
    
    ```rust
    fn checksig(pk: Pubkey, sig: Signature) {
        let msg: u256 = jet::sig_all_hash();
        jet::bip_0340_verify((pk, msg), sig);
    }
    
    fn enforce_relative_distance(min_distance: Distance) {
        // Transaction version must be at least 2 for BIP68 relative locktime to apply.
        assert!(jet::le_32(2, jet::version()));
    
        // Fetch and parse the current input's own sequence number.
        let actual_data: Either<Distance, Duration> = unwrap(jet::parse_sequence(jet::current_sequence()));
        let actual_distance: Distance = unwrap_left::<Duration>(actual_data);
    
        assert!(jet::le_16(min_distance, actual_distance));
    }
    
    // Enforce the covenant to repeat in the first output.
    //
    // Elements has explicit fee outputs, so enforce a fee output in the second output.
    // Disallow further outputs.
    fn recursive_covenant() {
        assert!(jet::eq_32(jet::num_outputs(), 2));
        let this_script_hash: u256 = jet::current_script_hash();
        let output_script_hash: u256 = unwrap(jet::output_script_hash(0));
        assert!(jet::eq_256(this_script_hash, output_script_hash));
        assert!(unwrap(jet::output_is_fee(1)));
    }
    
    fn inherit_spend(inheritor_sig: Signature) {
        let min_distance: Distance = param::MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS;
        enforce_relative_distance(min_distance);
        let inheritor_pk: Pubkey = param::INHERITOR_PUBLIC_KEY;
        checksig(inheritor_pk, inheritor_sig);
    }
    
    fn cold_spend(cold_sig: Signature) {
        let cold_pk: Pubkey = param::COLD_PUBLIC_KEY;
        checksig(cold_pk, cold_sig);
    }
    
    fn refresh_spend(hot_sig: Signature) {
        let hot_pk: Pubkey = param::HOT_PUBLIC_KEY;
        checksig(hot_pk, hot_sig);
        recursive_covenant();
    }
    
    enum Action {
        Inherit(Signature),
        ColdSpend(Signature),
        HotSpend(Signature),
    }
    
    fn main() {
        match witness::ACTION {
            Action::Inherit(sig: Signature) => inherit_spend(sig),
            Action::ColdSpend(sig: Signature) => cold_spend(sig),
            Action::HotSpend(sig: Signature) => refresh_spend(sig),
        }
    }
    ```
    
    The three public keys and the timelock length are compile-time [parameters](../glossary.md#parameter). In this Rust quickstart version, the keys are derived from a seed.
    
    You'll play the roles both of the benefactor and the inheritor, using two different [private keys](../glossary.md#private-key). In a real deployment, these keys would belong to different people. The benefactor would also have a "cold key", most likely kept offline.
    
    ??? "Using your own wallet instead"
        You can send the inherited coins to a wallet of your own instead of the default faucet-return address. If you have a Liquid-compatible wallet, via `elements-cli`, <a href="https://blockstream.com/app/">Blockstream App</a>, or otherwise, substitute it for the address below.

    Before beginning, please <a href="https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/">make sure you have Rust installed.</a>

    ## Demo walkthrough

    ### 1. Clone the walkthrough git repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity-demo
    cd simplicity-demo
    ```

    ### 2. Create a random seed for the demo's keypairs

    If you don't already have an `.env.demo` file from a prior quickstart tutorial, create one the same way:

    ```bash
    openssl rand -hex 32
    ```

    Create an `.env.demo` file at the top level of the `simplicity-demo` project, with a single line `SEED_HEX=` followed by your random seed value.

    Every `last-will` command below derives its keys from this one seed, at three different indices — `--hot-index` (default `0`), `--cold-index` (default `1`), and `--inheritor-index` (default `2`) — so you don't need to manage three separate seeds to play all three roles yourself. In a real deployment these would be three unrelated seeds held on different devices.

    ### 3. Compile the last-will contract

    ```bash
    cargo run last-will compile-to-testnet-address -v
    ```

    This derives all three keypairs from the seed, substitutes their public keys (and the default `--min-distance-blocks 3`) into `last_will.simf`, and compiles it. The output will look something like this:

    ```
    # Deriving keypairs from seed.
    # Compiling SimplicityHL program source_simf/last_will.simf.

    SimplicityHL source code:
        fn checksig(pk: Pubkey, sig: Signature) {
            ...
        }

        ...

    Parameter arguments (compile-time):
        mod param {
            const COLD_PUBLIC_KEY: u256 = 0x0804...;
            const HOT_PUBLIC_KEY: u256 = 0x4f35...;
            const INHERITOR_PUBLIC_KEY: u256 = 0x55f1...;
            const MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS: u16 = 3;
        }
    # Deriving Liquid Testnet address.
    ---> Inheritor public key: 55f1cd1f0ebdd80e86080ab56c02fb3f65c540f880f4e5e48bc1800e74c13606
    ---> Cold public key: 08040427cb5728a184a886897f0faed50353919e24b0571de75c45ef799821be
    ---> Hot public key: 4f355bdcb7cc0af728ef3cceb9615d90684bb5b2ca5f859ab0f0b704075871aa

    Contract's Liquid Testnet address: tex1p6df7ur00f9hc3k3y2g9ls6tl963sg59vm3pe9urytupxkhlpyrestuh6nm
    ```

    (Without `-v`, you'll just see the address on the last line.) `MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS` defaults to 3 purely so this quickstart finishes in a few minutes, as Liquid Network blocks are created once per minute.

    ### 4. Fund the contract on Liquid Testnet

    ```bash
    cargo run last-will fund-from-faucet --address tex1p6df7ur00f9hc3k3y2g9ls6tl963sg59vm3pe9urytupxkhlpyrestuh6nm
    ```

    (Substitute the address from your own Step 3 output.) This funds the contract with 100000 sats of tLBTC, and prints the funding transaction's ID — you'll need it for the next step. Wait for it to confirm (check <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a>) before continuing, since a relative timelock's clock starts at the confirming block, not at broadcast time.

    ### 5. Check in with the hot key

    This is the transaction the benefactor is expected to send periodically: it spends the current UTXO straight back to the *same contract address*, minus a fee, signed with the hot key. Producing this transaction is what resets the inheritor's timelock.

    ```bash
    cargo run last-will prove-alive --utxo <FAUCET_TXID>:0 --fee-sats 100 --broadcast
    ```

    Replace `<FAUCET_TXID>` with the transaction ID from Step 4. This derives all three keypairs again (needed to recompile the identical contract and re-derive its address), builds a transaction paying the contract's balance minus the fee back to itself, signs it with the hot key, builds the `Action::HotSpend` [witness](../glossary.md#witness), and — because `--broadcast` is set — submits it and prints the resulting txid.

    ??? "What's happening here?"
        Leave off `--broadcast` and the command prints the finalized raw transaction hex instead of submitting it.

    Wait for this transaction to confirm too, and note the block height it confirms at (visible on <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a>) — call it `HOT_CONFIRM_HEIGHT`. The inheritor's timelock is satisfied starting at block `HOT_CONFIRM_HEIGHT + 3` (or whatever `--min-distance-blocks` you used).

    ### 6. Try to inherit early — this should fail

    With the benefactor apparently still active, the inheritor shouldn't be able to claim anything yet:

    ```bash
    cargo run last-will spend-as-inheritor \
      --utxo <HOT_TXID>:0 \
      --to-address tex1q9hgs7pj8etd92rw5qz3dymvujffxzylmj6a28h \
      --fee-sats 100 \
      --broadcast
    ```

    Replace `<HOT_TXID>` with the txid from Step 5. This derives the keys, builds a transaction spending the hot-spend UTXO to the given destination, declares a relative-locktime distance of `--min-distance-blocks` (3 by default) on the input, signs with the inheritor's key, and builds the `Action::Inherit` witness — all of which succeeds locally, since the contract's own check only compares against the *declared* distance. The broadcast, though, should fail with something like `non-BIP68-final`: the node independently checks how many blocks have *actually* passed since `<HOT_TXID>` confirmed, and it's still close to zero.

    This is the same split explained on the [Timelocks](../documentation/timelocks.md#timelock-enforcement-mechanisms) page: Simplicity checks "does this transaction's declared `sequence` satisfy my rule?"; blockchain consensus separately checks "has enough real time actually passed to accept this `sequence`?" Both have to say yes.

    ### 7. Wait, then inherit for real

    Wait until the chain tip reaches `HOT_CONFIRM_HEIGHT + 3` (watch <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a>, or poll it the way the [bash quickstart](../getting-started/last-will-quickstart.md#part-3-wait) does). At roughly a block a minute on Liquid Testnet, this should take about three minutes.

    Then run the *identical* command from Step 6 again:

    ```bash
    cargo run last-will spend-as-inheritor \
      --utxo <HOT_TXID>:0 \
      --to-address tex1q9hgs7pj8etd92rw5qz3dymvujffxzylmj6a28h \
      --fee-sats 100 \
      --broadcast
    ```

    This time it should succeed, printing a txid. You can view the completed transaction on <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a>.

    ### Congratulations

    You've walked a single contract through all three roles of a realistic covenant: funding it, proving activity to keep it alive, watching the network itself enforce a timelock the contract applied, and finally exercising the fallback path once that timelock had genuinely elapsed.

    ??? "See more technical details"

=== "bash/CLI"

    # bash/CLI quickstart

    This is the **`bash`/CLI version** of the quickstart. You'll perform a [Liquid](../glossary.md#liquid) testnet transaction using the "last will" [covenant](../glossary.md#covenant). This allows an inheritor to claim funds after a delay if their benefactor goes silent, while letting the benefactor postpone that indefinitely just by checking in.

        assert!(unwrap(jet::output_is_fee(1)));
    }
    
    fn inherit_spend(inheritor_sig: Signature) {

        enforce_relative_distance(min_distance);
        let inheritor_pk: Pubkey = param::INHERITOR_PUBLIC_KEY;
        checksig(inheritor_pk, inheritor_sig);
    }
    
    fn cold_spend(cold_sig: Signature) {
        let cold_pk: Pubkey = param::COLD_PUBLIC_KEY;
        checksig(cold_pk, cold_sig);
    }
    
    fn refresh_spend(hot_sig: Signature) {
        let hot_pk: Pubkey = param::HOT_PUBLIC_KEY;

            Action::HotSpend(sig: Signature) => refresh_spend(sig),
        }
    }
    ```
    
    The three public keys and the timelock length are compile-time [parameters](../glossary.md#parameter). In this `bash` quickstart, the keys are hard-coded.
    
    You'll play the roles both of the benefactor and the inheritor, using two different [private keys](../glossary.md#private-key). In a real deployment, these keys would belong to different people. The benefactor would also have a "cold key", most likely kept offline.
    
    ??? "Using your own wallet instead"
        You can send the inherited coins to a wallet of your own instead of the default faucet-return address. If you have a Liquid-compatible wallet, via `elements-cli`, <a href="https://blockstream.com/app/">Blockstream App</a>, or otherwise, substitute it for the address below.

    Before beginning, please <a href="/documentation/toolchain">make sure you have installed the toolchain applications</a> (`simc` and `hal-simplicity`). You'll also need `curl` and `jq`.

    Save the contract above as `last_will.simf`.

    This contract uses SimplicityHL's `enum` feature, which is still experimental. Compiling it requires passing `-Z enums` to `simc`, as you'll see below.

    The three [public keys](../glossary.md#public-key) and the timelock length are compile-time [parameters](../glossary.md#parameter), not hardcoded — you'll supply them in an `.args` file, the same way the <a href="/getting-started/quickstart">traditional Rust quickstart</a> substitutes a public key into its P2PK contract.

    ??? note "Want to skip typing individual commands?"
        A complete script that runs every step below automatically is available at <a href="/assets/last-will-demo.sh">last-will-demo.sh</a>. Download it and run `bash last-will-demo.sh`. The walkthrough below explains what it's doing, step by step.

    ## Set up parameters

    ```bash
    INTERNAL_KEY="50929b74c1a04954b78b4b6035e97a5e078a5a0f28ec96d547bfee9ace803ac0"

    PRIVKEY_INHERITOR="0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
    PRIVKEY_COLD="0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
    PRIVKEY_HOT="0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003"

    INHERITOR_PUBLIC_KEY="0x79be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798"
    COLD_PUBLIC_KEY="0xc6047f9441ed7d6d3045406e95c07cd85c778e4b8cef3ca7abac09b95c709ee5"
    HOT_PUBLIC_KEY="0xf9308a019258c31049344f85f89d5229b531c845836f99b08601f113bce036f9"

    MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS=3

    DESTINATION_ADDRESS=tex1q9hgs7pj8etd92rw5qz3dymvujffxzylmj6a28h
    ```

    As in the <a href="/getting-started/bash-quickstart">P2MS quickstart</a>, `INTERNAL_KEY` is the standard BIP-0341 unspendable [internal key](../glossary.md#internal-key), and the private keys are intentionally the small integers 1, 2, and 3 — in a real contract these would be long random numbers, generated and held separately by each party. `DESTINATION_ADDRESS` is where the inheritor's claim will send funds; it defaults to a Liquid Testnet Faucet return address so nothing is wasted, but you can point it at your own wallet instead.

    `MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS` is set to 3 purely so this quickstart finishes in a few minutes. **[Liquid Testnet blocks land once a minute](../documentation/timelocks.md#timelock-measurement-units)**, so a longer, more realistic period is just a matter of raising this number — up to a point. `Distance` is a `u16`, capped at 65535, which at one block a minute is only about 45 days. A real deployment wanting something like a 180-day check-in period would need to swap `enforce_relative_distance`/`Distance` for [`enforce_relative_duration`/`Duration`](../documentation/timelocks.md#relative-timelock-in-simplicityhl) instead — `Duration`'s 65535 units of 512 seconds each reach a little over a year, comfortably covering 180 days.

    Now write out the `.args` file substituting these values into the contract's parameters:

    ```bash
    cat > last_will.args << EOF
    {
        "INHERITOR_PUBLIC_KEY": "$INHERITOR_PUBLIC_KEY",
        "COLD_PUBLIC_KEY": "$COLD_PUBLIC_KEY",
        "HOT_PUBLIC_KEY": "$HOT_PUBLIC_KEY",
        "MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS": "$MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS"
    }
    EOF
    ```

    ## Compile and fund the contract

    ```bash
    simc -Z enums last_will.simf -a last_will.args
    ```

    Now derive the contract's address and compute its [CMR](../glossary.md#cmr), which you'll need in later steps to attach the program to a [PSET](../glossary.md#pset):

    ```bash
    COMPILED_PROGRAM=$(simc -Z enums last_will.simf -a last_will.args --json | jq -r .program)
    CMR=$(hal-simplicity simplicity info "$COMPILED_PROGRAM" | jq -r .cmr)
    CONTRACT_ADDRESS=$(hal-simplicity simplicity info "$COMPILED_PROGRAM" | jq -r .liquid_testnet_address_unconf)
    ```

    Fund it from the Liquid Testnet Faucet, the same way the earlier quickstarts do:

    ```bash
    FAUCET_TXID=$(curl "https://liquidtestnet.com/api/faucet?address=$CONTRACT_ADDRESS&action=lbtc" 2>/dev/null | jq -r .txid)
    ```

    Wait for this transaction to confirm before continuing — check <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a>, or poll `https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/api/tx/$FAUCET_TXID/status` until it reports `"confirmed": true`. This matters here specifically because a relative timelock's clock starts at the confirming block, not at broadcast time, so the steps below need this input to have actually landed in a block.

    ## Part 1: Check in with the hot key

    This is the transaction the benefactor is expected to send periodically: it spends the current UTXO straight back to the *same contract address*, minus a [fee](../glossary.md#fee), signed with the hot key. Producing this transaction is what resets the inheritor's timelock — the covenant doesn't track a countdown anywhere; it just requires this specific action to keep happening.

    First, fetch the details of the UTXO you're about to spend:

    ```bash
    curl https://liquid.network/liquidtestnet/api/tx/$FAUCET_TXID > input-tx.json
    HEX=$(jq -r '.vout[0].scriptpubkey' < input-tx.json)
    ASSET=$(jq -r '.vout[0].asset' < input-tx.json)
    VALUE="0.00"$(jq -r '.vout[0].value' < input-tx.json)
    ```

    Build a [PSET](../glossary.md#pset) with two [outputs](../glossary.md#output): the refreshed contract, and an explicit fee. (This 2-output shape is exactly what `recursive_covenant()` checks for above — the contract will reject anything else.)

    ```bash
    PSET=$(hal-simplicity simplicity pset create \
      '[ { "txid": "'"$FAUCET_TXID"'", "vout": 0 } ]' \
      '[ { "'"$CONTRACT_ADDRESS"'": 0.00099900 }, { "fee": 0.00000100 } ]' \
      | jq -r .pset)

    PSET=$(hal-simplicity simplicity pset update-input "$PSET" 0 -i "$HEX:$ASSET:$VALUE" -c "$CMR" -p "$INTERNAL_KEY" | jq -r .pset)
    ```

    Sign it with the hot key, and build the witness. `witness::ACTION` needs to carry the `Action::HotSpend` enum variant along with the signature:

    ```bash
    HOT_SIGNATURE=$(hal-simplicity simplicity sighash "$PSET" 0 "$CMR" -x "$PRIVKEY_HOT" | jq -r .signature)

    cat > last_will.wit << EOF
    {
        "ACTION": "Action::HotSpend(0x$HOT_SIGNATURE)"
    }
    EOF
    ```

    Compile with the witness attached, finalize, extract, and broadcast:

    ```bash
    PROGRAM=$(simc -Z enums last_will.simf -a last_will.args -w last_will.wit --json | jq -r .program)
    WITNESS=$(simc -Z enums last_will.simf -a last_will.args -w last_will.wit --json | jq -r .witness)

    PSET=$(hal-simplicity simplicity pset finalize "$PSET" 0 "$PROGRAM" "$WITNESS" | jq -r .pset)
    RAW_TX=$(hal-simplicity simplicity pset extract "$PSET" | jq -r)

    HOT_TXID=$(curl -X POST "https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/api/tx" -d "$RAW_TX" 2>/dev/null)
    ```

    Wait for `HOT_TXID` to confirm before moving on — you'll need the [height](../glossary.md#height) it confirms at in a moment. Once the Explorer shows it as confirmed, fetch that height:

    ```bash
    HOT_CONFIRM_HEIGHT=$(curl -sSL https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/api/tx/$HOT_TXID/status | jq -r .block_height)
    ```

    ## Part 2: Try to inherit early — this should fail

    With the benefactor apparently still active, the inheritor shouldn't be able to claim anything yet. Let's confirm the contract actually enforces that, not just trust it.

    Fetch the hot-spend output's details, the same way as before:

    ```bash
    curl https://liquid.network/liquidtestnet/api/tx/$HOT_TXID > input-tx.json
    HEX=$(jq -r '.vout[0].scriptpubkey' < input-tx.json)
    ASSET=$(jq -r '.vout[0].asset' < input-tx.json)
    VALUE="0.00"$(jq -r '.vout[0].value' < input-tx.json)
    ```

    This time, build the PSET with a [`sequence`](../documentation/timelocks.md#creating-appropriate-transactions) value declaring a relative distance of `MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS`:

    ```bash
    PSET=$(hal-simplicity simplicity pset create \
      '[ { "txid": "'"$HOT_TXID"'", "vout": 0, "sequence": '"$MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS"' } ]' \
      '[ { "'"$DESTINATION_ADDRESS"'": 0.00099800 }, { "fee": 0.00000100 } ]' \
      | jq -r .pset)

    PSET=$(hal-simplicity simplicity pset update-input "$PSET" 0 -i "$HEX:$ASSET:$VALUE" -c "$CMR" -p "$INTERNAL_KEY" | jq -r .pset)
    ```

    Sign with the inheritor's key this time, and build an `Action::Inherit` witness:

    ```bash
    INHERITOR_SIGNATURE=$(hal-simplicity simplicity sighash "$PSET" 0 "$CMR" -x "$PRIVKEY_INHERITOR" | jq -r .signature)

    cat > last_will.wit << EOF
    {
        "ACTION": "Action::Inherit(0x$INHERITOR_SIGNATURE)"
    }
    EOF
    ```

    ```bash
    PROGRAM=$(simc -Z enums last_will.simf -a last_will.args -w last_will.wit --json | jq -r .program)
    WITNESS=$(simc -Z enums last_will.simf -a last_will.args -w last_will.wit --json | jq -r .witness)

    PSET=$(hal-simplicity simplicity pset finalize "$PSET" 0 "$PROGRAM" "$WITNESS" | jq -r .pset)
    INHERIT_RAW_TX=$(hal-simplicity simplicity pset extract "$PSET" | jq -r)
    ```

    Note that `finalize` and `extract` both **succeed**. That's expected: the contract's own check only compares against the `sequence` value you just declared, and 3 satisfies "at least 3". Now try broadcasting it anyway:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/api/tx" -d "$INHERIT_RAW_TX"
    ```

    This should be rejected with something like `non-BIP68-final`. The contract approved the transaction; the [node](../glossary.md#node) didn't, because it independently checks how many blocks have *actually* passed since `HOT_TXID` confirmed — and it's still close to zero. This is the same split explained on the [Timelocks](../documentation/timelocks.md#timelock-enforcement-mechanisms) page: Simplicity checks "does this transaction's declared `sequence` satisfy my rule?"; blockchain consensus separately checks "has enough real time actually passed to accept this `sequence`?" Both have to say yes.

    Hold onto `INHERIT_RAW_TX` — you'll resend the exact same bytes in Part 4, unchanged.

    ## Part 3: Wait

    ```bash
    TARGET_HEIGHT=$((HOT_CONFIRM_HEIGHT + MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS))
    echo "Waiting for block $TARGET_HEIGHT..."
    ```

    Poll the current chain tip until it reaches `TARGET_HEIGHT`:

    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/api/blocks/tip/height
    ```

    At roughly a block a minute, this should take about `MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS` minutes. Watch <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a> if you'd rather not poll from the command line.

    ## Part 4: Inherit for real

    Once the tip has reached `TARGET_HEIGHT`, resend the *identical* transaction from Part 2:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/api/tx" -d "$INHERIT_RAW_TX"
    ```

    This time it should be accepted, and you'll get back a txid. You can view the completed transaction on <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a>.

    ### Congratulations

    You've walked a single contract through all three roles of a realistic covenant: funding it, proving activity to keep it alive, watching the network itself enforce a timelock the contract applied, and finally exercising the fallback path once that timelock had genuinely elapsed.

    #### Next steps

    * Read more about how relative and absolute timelocks work, and why they can only enforce *minimum* times, in [Timelocks](../documentation/timelocks.md).
    * Read more about state and recursive covenants in [Covenants & State Management](../documentation/state.md).
    * Try the same story in Rust — see the <a href="https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity-demo">simplicity-demo</a> repository's `last-will` CLI commands.
    * See <a href="https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SimplicityHL/tree/master/examples">more example contracts</a> demonstrating other SimplicityHL language features.

    

=== "Python"

    # Python quickstart

    This is the **Python version** of the quickstart. You'll perform a [Liquid](../glossary.md#liquid) testnet transaction using the "last will" [covenant](../glossary.md#covenant). This allows an inheritor to claim funds after a delay if their benefactor goes silent, while letting the benefactor postpone that indefinitely just by checking in.

    ## The contract
    
    `last_will.simf` demonstrates an inheritance-after-timeout pattern, using three keys and three spending paths:
    
    * **Inheritor key** — after a [timelock](../glossary.md#timelock) has elapsed, the inheritor can claim everything.
    * **Hot key** — the benefactor can "check in" at any time. Checking in re-creates the exact same contract at a new [UTXO](../glossary.md#utxo) (a [recursive covenant](../glossary.md#recursive-covenant)) and resets the inheritor's timelock. This is the key the benefactor is expected to use day-to-day.
    * **Cold key** — the benefactor can also break out of the covenant entirely and move the funds anywhere, no matter what the timelock says. This key would typically be kept offline, since it's only needed in unusual circumstances. This quickstart doesn't exercise this path.

    Its code (from the <a href="https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/SimplicityHL/blob/master/examples/last_will.simf">SimplicityHL examples</a>) looks like this:
    
    ```rust

        let msg: u256 = jet::sig_all_hash();
        jet::bip_0340_verify((pk, msg), sig);
    }
    
    fn enforce_relative_distance(min_distance: Distance) {
        // Transaction version must be at least 2 for BIP68 relative locktime to apply.
        assert!(jet::le_32(2, jet::version()));
    
        // Fetch and parse the current input's own sequence number.
        let actual_data: Either<Distance, Duration> = unwrap(jet::parse_sequence(jet::current_sequence()));
        let actual_distance: Distance = unwrap_left::<Duration>(actual_data);
    
        assert!(jet::le_16(min_distance, actual_distance));
    }
    
    // Enforce the covenant to repeat in the first output.
    //
    // Elements has explicit fee outputs, so enforce a fee output in the second output.
    // Disallow further outputs.
    fn recursive_covenant() {
        assert!(jet::eq_32(jet::num_outputs(), 2));
        let this_script_hash: u256 = jet::current_script_hash();
        let output_script_hash: u256 = unwrap(jet::output_script_hash(0));
        assert!(jet::eq_256(this_script_hash, output_script_hash));
        assert!(unwrap(jet::output_is_fee(1)));
    }
    
    fn inherit_spend(inheritor_sig: Signature) {
        let min_distance: Distance = param::MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS;
        enforce_relative_distance(min_distance);
        let inheritor_pk: Pubkey = param::INHERITOR_PUBLIC_KEY;
        checksig(inheritor_pk, inheritor_sig);
    }
    
    fn cold_spend(cold_sig: Signature) {
        let cold_pk: Pubkey = param::COLD_PUBLIC_KEY;
        checksig(cold_pk, cold_sig);
    }
    
    fn refresh_spend(hot_sig: Signature) {
        let hot_pk: Pubkey = param::HOT_PUBLIC_KEY;
        checksig(hot_pk, hot_sig);
        recursive_covenant();
    }
    
    enum Action {
        Inherit(Signature),
        ColdSpend(Signature),
        HotSpend(Signature),
    }
    
    fn main() {
        match witness::ACTION {
            Action::Inherit(sig: Signature) => inherit_spend(sig),
            Action::ColdSpend(sig: Signature) => cold_spend(sig),
            Action::HotSpend(sig: Signature) => refresh_spend(sig),
        }
    }
    ```
    
    The three public keys and the timelock length are compile-time [parameters](../glossary.md#parameter). In this Python quickstart, the keys will be hard-coded.
    
    You'll play the roles both of the benefactor and the inheritor, using two different [private keys](../glossary.md#private-key). In a real deployment, these keys would belong to different people. The benefactor would also have a "cold key", most likely kept offline.
    
    ??? "Using your own wallet instead"
        You can send the inherited coins to a wallet of your own instead of the default faucet-return address. If you have a Liquid-compatible wallet, via `elements-cli`, <a href="https://blockstream.com/app/">Blockstream App</a>, or otherwise, substitute it for the address below.

    This version is driven through the Python bindings for [`lwk`](https://github.com/Blockstream/lwk), Blockstream's Liquid Wallet Kit.

    !!! warning "Temporary: you'll need to patch and rebuild `lwk` first"
        `lwk`'s Python bindings currently pin an older SimplicityHL (0.5.0) that predates the `-Z enums` feature this contract needs, and don't yet expose a couple of small primitives every enum-based contract needs (constructing an `enum` witness value, and looking up the type of a declared witness). None of this is `last_will`-specific — any SimplicityHL contract using `enum` hits the same gap — but until it's addressed upstream, following this quickstart means building a patched `lwk` yourself:

        1. Clone the repository:
            ```bash
            git clone https://github.com/Blockstream/lwk
            cd lwk
            ```
        2. Download <a href="/assets/last-will-lwk-patch.patch">last-will-lwk-patch.patch</a> and apply it:
            ```bash
            git apply last-will-lwk-patch.patch
            ```
            This bumps the `simplicityhl` dependency to 0.7.1 and adds `SimplicityProgram.load_with_unstable_features`, `SimplicityTypedValue.enum_variant`, `SimplicityProgram.witness_type`, and a general-purpose `simplicity_sign_schnorr` function (not used below, but fixes a related gap: the existing `create_p2pk_signature` incorrectly assumes the signer's key is also the contract's Taproot internal key, which isn't true for a shared-internal-key covenant like this one).
        3. Build and install the Python wheel:
            ```bash
            pip install maturin
            maturin build --release -m lwk_bindings/Cargo.toml -b uniffi --features simplicity
            pip install --force-reinstall target/wheels/lwk-*.whl
            ```

        Separately: the `lwk` package on PyPI doesn't currently ship *any* Simplicity bindings, patched or not (its default build omits the `simplicity` feature), so `pip install lwk` alone isn't enough even setting the above aside — you need a wheel built with `--features simplicity` regardless.

        This box exists to make the quickstart runnable *today*, but these steps should become unnecessary with future fixes to `lwk`.

    This contract uses SimplicityHL's `enum` feature, which is still experimental. Compiling it requires enabling the `enums` unstable feature — in Python, that means passing `["enums"]` to `SimplicityProgram.load_with_unstable_features()`, as you'll see below (the patch from the box above is what makes that method exist at all).

    The three [public keys](../glossary.md#public-key) and the timelock length are compile-time [parameters](../glossary.md#parameter), not hardcoded — you'll supply them as `SimplicityArguments` below, Python's equivalent of the `.args` file the bash and Rust quickstarts use.

    ??? note "Want to skip typing individual commands?"
        A complete script that runs every step below automatically is available at <a href="/assets/last-will-demo.py">last-will-demo.py</a>. Download it (and build the patched `lwk` wheel from the box above first) and run `python3 last-will-demo.py`. The walkthrough below explains what it's doing, step by step.

    ## Set up parameters

    Everything from here on is plain Python. Start a `python3` session (or a script) in the same directory as `last_will.simf` using the `lwk_simplicity`-built Python interpreter, and run these blocks in order.

    ```python
    import json
    import time
    import urllib.error
    import urllib.request

    from lwk import (
        Address,
        Network,
        Keypair,
        OutPoint,
        PsetBuilder,
        PsetInputBuilder,
        PsetOutputBuilder,
        Script,
        SimplicityArguments,
        SimplicityLogLevel,
        SimplicityProgram,
        SimplicityTypedValue,
        SimplicityWitnessValues,
        Txid,
        TxOut,
        TxSequence,
        XOnlyPublicKey,
    )

    network = Network.testnet()
    policy_asset = network.policy_asset()

    # The standard BIP-0341 unspendable internal key: a Taproot internal key with
    # no known private key. Used so the only way to spend the contract is via one
    # of its script paths -- there is no hidden key-path spend.
    INTERNAL_KEY = XOnlyPublicKey.from_string(
        "50929b74c1a04954b78b4b6035e97a5e078a5a0f28ec96d547bfee9ace803ac0"
    )

    # The private keys are intentionally the small integers 1, 2, and 3 -- in a
    # real contract these would be long random numbers, generated and held
    # separately by each party.
    kp_inheritor = Keypair.from_secret_bytes(bytes.fromhex(
        "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
    ))
    kp_cold = Keypair.from_secret_bytes(bytes.fromhex(
        "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
    ))
    kp_hot = Keypair.from_secret_bytes(bytes.fromhex(
        "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003"
    ))

    MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS = 3

    # Where the inheritor's claim will send funds; defaults to a Liquid Testnet
    # Faucet return address so nothing is wasted, but you can point it at your
    # own wallet instead.
    DESTINATION_ADDRESS = "tex1q9hgs7pj8etd92rw5qz3dymvujffxzylmj6a28h"
    ```

    `MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS` is set to 3 purely so this quickstart finishes in a few minutes. **[Liquid Testnet blocks land once a minute](../documentation/timelocks.md#timelock-measurement-units)**, so a longer, more realistic period is just a matter of raising this number — up to a point. `Distance` is a `u16`, capped at 65535, which at one block a minute is only about 45 days. A real deployment wanting something like a 180-day check-in period would need to swap `enforce_relative_distance`/`Distance` for [`enforce_relative_duration`/`Duration`](../documentation/timelocks.md#relative-timelock-in-simplicityhl) instead.

    A couple of small helpers for talking to the Faucet and Esplora over HTTP, since this quickstart deliberately avoids any extra dependency beyond `lwk` itself:

    ```python
    BASE_URL = "https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet"
    FAUCET_URL = "https://liquidtestnet.com/api/faucet"

    def get_json(url):
        with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as resp:
            return json.load(resp)

    def get_text(url):
        with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as resp:
            return resp.read().decode().strip()

    def broadcast(raw_tx_hex):
        req = urllib.request.Request(f"{BASE_URL}/api/tx", data=raw_tx_hex.encode(), method="POST")
        try:
            with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as resp:
                return resp.read().decode().strip()
        except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
            raise RuntimeError(e.read().decode().strip()) from e

    def wait_for_confirmation(txid):
        print(f"Waiting for {txid} to confirm", end="", flush=True)
        while True:
            status = get_json(f"{BASE_URL}/api/tx/{txid}/status")
            if status.get("confirmed"):
                height = status["block_height"]
                print(f" confirmed at height {height}.")
                return height
            print(".", end="", flush=True)
            time.sleep(5)

    def wait_for_tip_height(target):
        print(f"Waiting for the chain tip to reach block {target}...")
        while True:
            tip = int(get_text(f"{BASE_URL}/api/blocks/tip/height"))
            print(f"  current tip: {tip} (need {target})")
            if tip >= target:
                return
            time.sleep(15)
    ```

    ## Compile and fund the contract

    ```python
    LAST_WILL_SOURCE = open("last_will.simf").read()

    args = SimplicityArguments()
    args = args.add_value("INHERITOR_PUBLIC_KEY", SimplicityTypedValue.u256(kp_inheritor.x_only_public_key().to_bytes()))
    args = args.add_value("COLD_PUBLIC_KEY", SimplicityTypedValue.u256(kp_cold.x_only_public_key().to_bytes()))
    args = args.add_value("HOT_PUBLIC_KEY", SimplicityTypedValue.u256(kp_hot.x_only_public_key().to_bytes()))
    args = args.add_value("MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS", SimplicityTypedValue.u16(MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS))

    program = SimplicityProgram.load_with_unstable_features(LAST_WILL_SOURCE, args, ["enums"])
    print("CMR:", program.cmr())
    ```

    Derive the contract's address, the same way `hal-simplicity simplicity info` does in the bash version:

    ```python
    contract_address = program.create_p2tr_address(INTERNAL_KEY, network)
    contract_script = contract_address.script_pubkey()
    print("Address:", contract_address)
    ```

    Fund it from the Liquid Testnet Faucet:

    ```python
    faucet_txid = get_json(f"{FAUCET_URL}?address={contract_address}&action=lbtc")["txid"]
    print("Funding txid:", faucet_txid)
    ```

    Wait for this transaction to confirm before continuing:

    ```python
    wait_for_confirmation(faucet_txid)
    ```

    This matters here specifically because a relative timelock's clock starts at the confirming block, not at broadcast time, so the steps below need this input to have actually landed in a block.

    ## Part 1: Check in with the hot key

    This is the transaction the benefactor is expected to send periodically: it spends the current UTXO straight back to the *same contract address*, minus a [fee](../glossary.md#fee), signed with the hot key. Producing this transaction is what resets the inheritor's timelock — the covenant doesn't track a countdown anywhere; it just requires this specific action to keep happening.

    First, fetch the details of the UTXO you're about to spend, and wrap it as a `TxOut` — note that unlike the bash version, there's no BTC/satoshi decimal juggling here, since `lwk`'s builders just take integer satoshis directly:

    ```python
    input_tx = get_json(f"{BASE_URL}/api/tx/{faucet_txid}")
    vout0 = input_tx["vout"][0]
    funding_value = vout0["value"]
    funding_asset = vout0["asset"]
    tx_out = TxOut.from_explicit(contract_script, funding_asset, funding_value)
    ```

    Build a [PSET](../glossary.md#pset) with two [outputs](../glossary.md#output): the refreshed contract, and an explicit fee. (This 2-output shape is exactly what `recursive_covenant()` checks for above — the contract will reject anything else.)

    ```python
    input_builder = PsetInputBuilder.from_prevout(OutPoint.from_parts(Txid(faucet_txid), 0))
    input_builder.witness_utxo(tx_out)

    pset_builder = PsetBuilder.new_v2()
    pset_builder.add_input(input_builder.build())

    fee = 100
    pset_builder.add_output(PsetOutputBuilder.new_explicit(contract_script, funding_value - fee, funding_asset).build())
    pset_builder.add_output(PsetOutputBuilder.new_explicit(Script.empty(), fee, funding_asset).build())

    pset = pset_builder.build()
    unsigned_tx = pset.extract_tx()
    ```

    Sign it with the hot key, and build the witness. `witness::ACTION` needs to carry the `Action::HotSpend` enum variant along with the signature — this is what `SimplicityTypedValue.enum_variant` and `SimplicityProgram.witness_type` (both from the patch above) are for:

    ```python
    sighash = program.get_sighash_all(unsigned_tx, INTERNAL_KEY, [tx_out], 0, network)
    hot_signature = kp_hot.sign_schnorr(sighash.hex())

    action_type = program.witness_type("ACTION")
    action_value = SimplicityTypedValue.enum_variant(
        action_type, "HotSpend", [SimplicityTypedValue.byte_array(bytes.fromhex(hot_signature))]
    )
    witness_values = SimplicityWitnessValues().add_value("ACTION", action_value)
    ```

    Finalize and broadcast:

    ```python
    finalized_tx = program.finalize_transaction(
        unsigned_tx, INTERNAL_KEY, [tx_out], 0, witness_values, network, SimplicityLogLevel.NONE
    )
    hot_txid = broadcast(finalized_tx.bytes().hex())
    print("Broadcast:", hot_txid)
    ```

    Wait for `hot_txid` to confirm before moving on — you'll need the [height](../glossary.md#height) it confirms at in a moment:

    ```python
    hot_confirm_height = wait_for_confirmation(hot_txid)
    target_height = hot_confirm_height + MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS
    ```

    ## Part 2: Try to inherit early — this should fail

    With the benefactor apparently still active, the inheritor shouldn't be able to claim anything yet. Let's confirm the contract actually enforces that, not just trust it.

    Fetch the hot-spend output's details, the same way as before:

    ```python
    input_tx = get_json(f"{BASE_URL}/api/tx/{hot_txid}")
    vout0 = input_tx["vout"][0]
    funding_value = vout0["value"]
    funding_asset = vout0["asset"]
    tx_out = TxOut.from_explicit(contract_script, funding_asset, funding_value)
    ```

    This time, build the PSET with a [`sequence`](../documentation/timelocks.md#creating-appropriate-transactions) value declaring a relative distance of `MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS`, via `PsetInputBuilder.sequence()`:

    ```python
    input_builder = PsetInputBuilder.from_prevout(OutPoint.from_parts(Txid(hot_txid), 0))
    input_builder.witness_utxo(tx_out)
    input_builder.sequence(TxSequence.from_height(MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS))

    pset_builder = PsetBuilder.new_v2()
    pset_builder.add_input(input_builder.build())

    destination_script = Address(DESTINATION_ADDRESS).script_pubkey()
    fee = 100
    pset_builder.add_output(PsetOutputBuilder.new_explicit(destination_script, funding_value - fee, funding_asset).build())
    pset_builder.add_output(PsetOutputBuilder.new_explicit(Script.empty(), fee, funding_asset).build())

    pset = pset_builder.build()
    unsigned_tx = pset.extract_tx()
    ```

    Sign with the inheritor's key this time, and build an `Action::Inherit` witness:

    ```python
    sighash = program.get_sighash_all(unsigned_tx, INTERNAL_KEY, [tx_out], 0, network)
    inheritor_signature = kp_inheritor.sign_schnorr(sighash.hex())

    action_value = SimplicityTypedValue.enum_variant(
        action_type, "Inherit", [SimplicityTypedValue.byte_array(bytes.fromhex(inheritor_signature))]
    )
    witness_values = SimplicityWitnessValues().add_value("ACTION", action_value)

    finalized_tx = program.finalize_transaction(
        unsigned_tx, INTERNAL_KEY, [tx_out], 0, witness_values, network, SimplicityLogLevel.NONE
    )
    inherit_raw_tx = finalized_tx.bytes().hex()
    ```

    Note that `finalize_transaction` **succeeds**. That's expected: the contract's own check only compares against the `sequence` value you just declared, and 3 satisfies "at least 3". Now try broadcasting it anyway:

    ```python
    broadcast(inherit_raw_tx)
    ```

    This should raise a `RuntimeError` with something like `non-BIP68-final`. The contract approved the transaction; the [node](../glossary.md#node) didn't, because it independently checks how many blocks have *actually* passed since `hot_txid` confirmed — and it's still close to zero. This is the same split explained on the [Timelocks](../documentation/timelocks.md#timelock-enforcement-mechanisms) page: Simplicity checks "does this transaction's declared `sequence` satisfy my rule?"; blockchain consensus separately checks "has enough real time actually passed to accept this `sequence`?" Both have to say yes.

    Hold onto `inherit_raw_tx` — you'll resend the exact same bytes in Part 4, unchanged.

    ## Part 3: Wait

    ```python
    print(f"Waiting for block {target_height}...")
    wait_for_tip_height(target_height)
    ```

    At roughly a block a minute, this should take about `MIN_DISTANCE_BLOCKS` minutes. Watch <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a> if you'd rather not poll from Python.

    ## Part 4: Inherit for real

    Once the tip has reached `target_height`, resend the *identical* transaction from Part 2:

    ```python
    inherit_txid = broadcast(inherit_raw_tx)
    print("Inherited:", inherit_txid)
    ```

    This time it should be accepted, and you'll get back a txid. You can view the completed transaction on <a href="https://blockstream.info/liquidtestnet/">the Explorer</a>.

    ### Congratulations

    You've walked a single contract through all three roles of a realistic covenant: funding it, proving activity to keep it alive, watching the network itself enforce a timelock the contract applied, and finally exercising the fallback path once that timelock had genuinely elapsed.

    #### Next steps

    * Read more about how relative and absolute timelocks work, and why they can only enforce *minimum* times, in [Timelocks](../documentation/timelocks.md).
    * Read more about state and recursive covenants in [Covenants & State Management](../documentation/state.md).
    * Try the same story in bash or Rust — see the <a href="/getting-started/last-will-quickstart">bash quickstart</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/simplicity-demo">simplicity-demo</a> repository's `last-will` CLI commands.
